      <h3>Transformative Journey</h3>
      <p>
        "When my sister was diagnosed with an aggressive, rare form of cancer, I
        decided to change my life," Dr. Gendreau, who had reached 300 lbs. by
        consuming "a diet full of bread, pasta and chips," told PEOPLE. "For me,
        being obese was a choice. How could I literally eat myself to death
        while my poor sister was fighting for her life?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary care physician started on a high-fat, low-carb diet and
        tracked his progress through MyFitnessPal.
      </p>
      <p>
        "As my sister's condition worsened, I became more motivated than ever to
        eat healthfully because I knew my niece [Sophia] and nephew [Henry]
        would need me to be at my best," said Dr. Gendreau. Sadly, his sister
        died in June 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
        On his new whole food diet, he saw "astonishing" results by eliminating
        processed carbs and sticking to fruits, vegetables, nuts, chicken,
        turkey, fish, eggs, non-fat Greek yogurt, olive oil, balsamic vinegar
        and non-caloric spices and seasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
        After his weight hit a plateau, Dr. Gendreau turned to intermittent
        fasting, which helped him shed the last 50 lbs. of the 125 lbs. he lost.
        He started eating from only 12 p.m. to 8 p.m. every day. Outside of that
        window, he would allow himself black tea, black coffee and water.
      </p>
      <p>
        He even began recommending his routine to patients. "Intermittent
        fasting has been life-changing for many of my pre-diabetic and diabetic
        patients," Dr. Gendreau said. But he cautioned, "Intermittent fasting is
        safe for most people, but not everyone. You should definitely talk to
        your own doctor before starting any diet or exercise plan."

      <h3>Transformative Journey</h3>

      <p>
        At 280 lbs., Gwilym Pugh was out of shape and living a sedentary life.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a "five- to seven-year" weight-loss journey, which included a lot
        of "trial and error," Pugh lost 93 lbs. and found a new career.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a top model and an ambassador for David Beckham's grooming brand
        House 99, Pugh told PEOPLE he focuses on a diet of micronutrients and
        good fats, along with manageable exercise. "Due to injuries, I've
        struggled with high-intensity work, but I've found low-intensity cardio
        pre-breakfast has been great," said Pugh, who started seeing an
        osteopath and a trainer while aiming for 20,000 steps per day.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for life as an in-demand model and social media influencer: "This
        life is something I had never even thought to dream of," said the
        London-based Pugh. "Every aspect of my life has improved, from physical
        and mental health to personal and professional relationships."

      <h3>Transformative Journey</h3>
      <p>
        After Mike Bauler's father-in-law went on life support following a heart
        attack in 2010, the Madison, Wisc., resident said he knew he needed to
        change his own ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        "At this time I was 28, had two young boys, Eli (2) and Carson (6
        months)," he told PEOPLE. "I recall all of the family standing around
        crying and sad. This was the trigger for me as I knew if I didn't get my
        life together soon, I would be the next person in that hospital bed."
      </p>
      <p>
        A few weeks after his father-in-law was admitted to the hospital,
        Bauler, who weighed 450 lbs. at his heaviest, signed up at a local gym.
        He first focused on exercising and eventually made changes to his diet,
        sticking to 1,500 calories a day and smaller portion sizes for one year.
      </p>
      <p>
        After losing weight, Bauler began running every day and completed
        endurance competitions like Ironman and Ragnar. "I lost most of my
        weight (200 lbs.) in about 18 months so I have had to stay busy to keep
        it off," he said. "I am extremely competitive and have an amazing
        network of friends and the From Fat to Finish Line (FFTFL) community. I
        like to join training groups and training clubs because of the
        friendships and accountability it creates. It would be easy for me to
        blow off a 10-mile run at 5:30 on a Friday morning, but I know I have
        two friends meeting me, who I would never let down."

      <h3>Transformative Journey</h3>
      <b
        >What was the driving force that made you decide you wanted to start
        your fitness journey?</b
      >
      <p>
        In high school, I grew really fast. That being said, I was just the tall
        skinny kid. Then, I found the online fitness community and decided that
        I wanted to look like the guys in the videos. I started school at the
        University and had access to a very nice gym. I decided it was time I
        applied my full effort and achieve my goals. When I actually saw that I
        could gain muscle, I was hooked.
      </p>
      <b>What was your lifestyle like prior to your change?</b>
      <p>
        I maybe went to the gym 1-2 times a week prior to college. I never took
        it seriously; it was more of a casual outgoing with my friends. My
        nutrition was pretty much whatever I wanted and when I wanted.
      </p>
      <b
        >What was your weight training approach and split during your
        transformation?</b
      >
      <p>
        I used a 5-day workout split. The order was Legs, Chest, Arms,
        Shoulders, Back. The off days were not set on specific days. I took them
        on days I felt I needed them.
      </p>
      <h3>TRANSFORMATION DIET & NUTRITION</h3>
      <b>What was your diet/nutrition approach during your transformation?</b>
      <p>
        At first I just thought, well big strong people eat a lot I guess, so
        ill eat more. Little did I know, essentially I was “bulking”.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always been able to eat a lot, thats never been an issue for me.
        When I finally started to learn about nutrition I learned I was eating
        4,000 calories a day. When I decided to do a cut, I dropped my calories
        to 2,600-3,000.
      </p>
      <b>Can you provide us with a sample daily eating plan?</b>

      <h3>Transformative Journey</h3>
      <b>Lifestyle Prior To Change</b>
      <p>
        I was really into basketball and pro wrestling. I liked the then WWF
        (now WWE) and WCW because the guys were huge and I wanted to be like
        that, especially Goldberg. I was quiet and picked on a lot in high
        school. I was a senior back then and very depressed.
      </p>
      <b>What Was Your Turning Point?</b>
      <p>
        The turning point was when I got a video in the mail. To this day I don
        not know how or why it got sent to me. It was called Body of Work and it
        was by Bill Phillips. He is most known as writing Body-for-Life. After
        seeing those transformations I decided I had to do this. A couple of
        months into it, my girlfriend wanted to date someone bigger and had no
        faith in me so she dumped me on my 18th birthday. I was driven from that
        point on.
      </p>
      <b>What Was Your Exercise Plan?</b>
      <p>
        I did not want to reinvent the wheel so I stuck with basic compound
        movements. Bench press, squat, deadlift, dips, pull ups, rows, etc. I
        would throw in an isolation movement or two for balance. I also went
        heavy. I had a spotter every time I lifted. I would do reps around 6-10
        and max out on bench, deadlift, and squat every 4 weeks. I only did
        cardio once a week since I wanted to get bigger. I did walk to the gym
        for warm up and cool down.
      </p>
      <b>What Was Your Diet Plan?</b>
      <p>
        1.5 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight, 2.5 grams of carbs per
        pound of bodyweight and about 80-90 grams of fat per day. I also took in
        1 gallon of water a day. All of this was over 6 balanced meals a day.
      </p>
      <h3>Advice For Others</h3>
      <p>
        As corny as it sounds, I am living proof. If you believe…honestly
        believe in your heart that you can do it, you can do anything you set
        your mind to. It is just a matter of how bad you want it.
